## Disclaimers
> [!WARNING]
> This project is a work in progress. Bugs **are to be expected**.
- This is a personal project. I'm using it for learning purposes, but if there's enough interest I might change the approach.
- Recommendations are welcome so feel free to open issues.

## Instructions
By now, you'll need to build it yourself. Microsoft is preventing me from publishing the extension on their store, so I either figure that out or go an alternative path.
